# Smogon Usage Parser Discord Bot 

This project utilizes the information from Griffin Ledingham's Smogon Usage Parser to create an interactive Discord bot, utilizing discord.py, which displays Pokemon information and usage statistics based on information obtained through the original application.

# Usage

Currently, the bot supports the following commands:

Load data: ```/request_data format date rating```
    Example: ```/request_data gen7vgc2019ultraseries 2019-08 1760```
Query data: ```/test_data pokemonName```
    Example: ```/test_data Incineroar```
Shutdown: ```/shutdown```

The current implementation is a work in progress, but the goal of the project is to create an easy-to-use, informative tool for competitive Pokemon players to promote collaborative teambuilding and gather and present Smogon statistics in one place.
